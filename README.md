# 17lands-
Using 17 lands data to practice using various programming languages to extract useful and interesting insights 
This data is publicly available from the team at 17lands, https://www.17lands.com/, which collects information about drafts conducted on the MTG arena client such as when cards are picked, and information from a turn by turn breakdown of the games played such as winrates of individual cards.
The current goals of this project are to develop a linear model that can predict the percentage chance of victory on a turn by turn basis with reasonable accuracy, depending on the current game state and insights into what a major shift in what percent to win looks like. 
However as experimentation progress the goals of this project may change
